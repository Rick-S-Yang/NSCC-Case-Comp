## Overview
- This project presents our case competition solution, covering:
  - Problem framing & objectives
  - Situation analysis (market / customer / financials)
  - Recommendation & rationale
  - Implementation roadmap & risks
  - Expected impact (KPIs)

## Key Takeaways
- **Brand trust, not price, is the binding constraint:**  
  Despite strong operational performance (99%+ completion rate, ~89% on-time), Flair suffers from reputational damage driven by negative media coverage and inconsistent messaging, which undermines consumer trust.

- **Mismatch between Ultra Low Cost Carrier positioning and Gen Z engagement:**  
  While Gen Z travelers value affordability, social proof, and digital-native discovery (TikTok, influencers), Flair lacks targeted, segment-specific campaigns and a consistent brand presence within its core growth markets (GTA, Gen Z).

- **Transparency and engagement can convert performance into credibility:**  
  By making reliability metrics visible (live performance dashboard), rebranding social media with consistent visual identity, and launching localized, experience-driven campaigns, Flair can rebuild trust and improve brand affinity without sacrificing its ULCC cost advantage.
